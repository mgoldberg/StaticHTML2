				There is an extrodinarily high chance that you have seen an animal under the category of bird before.  I just saw one fly right past my window.  That's right I said <text id = "stressed"> fly</text>!  One of the coolest things about birds is that most of them can sustain self powered flight.  Another destinctive trait that all birds have are feathers.  We'll go into more detail later, but for now just know that feathers are similar to long hairs that branch off into other hairs.  All birds also have beaks.  They com in many shapes and sizes, but they are generally pointy yellow triangles at the front of a birds head.  This is the location of the bird's mouth and nose.  Do you remeber seeing a bird yet?  Well hold onto your ostreches because there is a lot more to our feathery friends that meet the eye.
